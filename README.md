## About Laravel

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel takes the pain out of development by easing common tasks used in many web projects, such as:

- [Simple, fast routing engine](https://laravel.com/docs/routing).
- [Powerful dependency injection container](https://laravel.com/docs/container).
- Multiple back-ends for [session](https://laravel.com/docs/session) and [cache](https://laravel.com/docs/cache) storage.
- Expressive, intuitive [database ORM](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent).
- Database agnostic [schema migrations](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations).
- [Robust background job processing](https://laravel.com/docs/queues).
- [Real-time event broadcasting](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting).

Laravel is accessible, powerful, and provides tools required for large, robust applications.

## Learning Laravel

Laravel has the most extensive and thorough [documentation](https://laravel.com/docs) and video tutorial library of all modern web application frameworks, making it a breeze to get started with the framework.

You may also try the [Laravel Bootcamp](https://bootcamp.laravel.com), where you will be guided through building a modern Laravel application from scratch.

If you don't feel like reading, [Laracasts](https://laracasts.com) can help. Laracasts contains thousands of video tutorials on a range of topics including Laravel, modern PHP, unit testing, and JavaScript. Boost your skills by digging into our comprehensive video library.

# ðŸš€ Step-by-Step: Laravel +  on Windows

## 1. ðŸ›  Create a Laravel Project

Open PowerShell or CMD:

```bash
composer create-project laravel/laravel simple-validator-laravel
cd simple-validator-laravel
```

Or using Laravel installer:

```bash
laravel new simple-validator-laravel
cd simple-validator-laravel
```

---

## 2. ðŸ“¦ Install Node Modules

```bash
npm install
```

---

## 3. ðŸ“¥ Install Your NPM Package

```bash
npm install  inji-verify-sdk
```

---


---

## 5. ðŸ”— Import It in `resources/js/app.js`

Open `resources/js/app.js` and add:

```js
import InjiVerify from 'inji-verify-sdk';
```
import {VCverification} from 'inji-verify-sdk';

// Example usage:
const fileInput = document.querySelector('input[type="file"]');
fileInput.addEventListener('change', async (event) => {
  const file = event.target.files[0];
  const url = 'https://your-verification-endpoint.com/verify';

  const result = await VCverification(file, url);
  console.log(result);
});
---

## 6. ðŸ§ª Add Script in Blade Template

Open `resources/views/welcome.blade.php` (or any Blade view) and add:

```blade
@vite(['resources/css/app.css', 'resources/js/app.js'])
```

âœ… This ensures Vite bundles and serves your script.

---

## 7. ðŸ”¥ Start Vite and Laravel

In one terminal:

```bash
npm run dev
```

In another terminal:

```bash
php artisan serve
```

---

## 8. âœ… Open Browser 

Go to [http://127.0.0.1:8000](http://127.0.0.1:8000)


For more information, check out the [Inji Verify SDK documentation](https://www.npmjs.com/package/inji-verify-sdk).

---

## ðŸ§¼ Optional: Using In React/Vue?

If you're working with a React or Vue.js project, you can easily integrate the **inji-verify-sdk** in a similar way by importing the NPM package and using it in your components or Vue files.
